## 🚀 Best Model Used: **Decision Tree Regressor**  

🔹 **Why this model?**  
- I experimented with different machine learning models like **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree Regressor**.  
- After evaluating their **performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**, I found that the **Decision Tree Regressor** gave the best accuracy on this dataset.  

🔹 **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
- Used `max_depth` and `min_samples_split` tuning to optimize the Decision Tree model.  
- Checked performance using **cross-validation** to avoid overfitting.

## 📌 Dataset Used  
- This project is based on the **Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset**.  
- The dataset contains information about various houses and their sale prices, along with different features like **Lot Area, Year Built, Number of Floors, Number of Bedrooms, and Bathrooms**.

## 📌 Notes & Learnings  
📢 **Key Takeaways from this Project:**  
- **Feature Selection Matters:** Not all features contribute equally to the prediction.  
- **Overfitting is a Real Issue:** If `max_depth` is too high in Decision Trees, it can memorize training data but perform poorly on test data.  
- **Tuning Parameters is Crucial:** Small changes in `min_samples_split` and `max_depth` can significantly impact performance.
